Encoder --> LED  
	Step-by-Step Connection Guide
	For the LED Strip:

	Connect Arduino 5V pin to the breadboard's positive (+) power rail
	Connect Arduino GND pin to the breadboard's negative (-) power rail
	Connect the LED strip's 5V/VCC (red wire) to the breadboard's positive (+) power rail
	Connect the LED strip's GND (black or white wire) to the breadboard's negative (-) power rail
	Connect Arduino pin 9 to any empty row on the breadboard (let's call it row A)
	Place one end of the 330-470 ohm resistor in the same row A (where Arduino pin 9 is connected)
	Place the other end of the resistor in a different empty row (let's call it row B)
	Connect the LED strip's Data In/DIN (typically green or yellow wire) to row B (where the other end of the resistor is)

	For the Rotary Encoder:

	Place the rotary encoder in the breadboard, ensuring each pin connects to different rows
	Connect the encoder's CLK pin to Arduino pin 5
	Connect the encoder's DT pin to Arduino pin 4
	Connect the encoder's SW (switch) pin to Arduino pin 3
	Connect the encoder's + or VCC pin to the breadboard's positive (+) power rail
	Connect the encoder's GND pin to the breadboard's negative (-) power rail

	Verification:

	Double-check all connections, making sure the LED strip is oriented correctly (look for arrows showing data flow direction)
	Ensure the resistor is properly connecting Arduino pin 9 to the LED strip's data input
	Verify all ground connections are secure
	Make sure there are no shorts or loose connections on the breadboard

	Once you've completed these steps, you can upload the code I provided earlier. Remember to adjust the NUM_LEDS value in the code to match the number of LEDs in your strip.
